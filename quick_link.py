"""quick_link.py — generate a 1-Click vkturnproxy:// connection-link URL.

The output is a single `vkturnproxy://import?data=<base64>` string ready
to AirDrop / message / paste onto an iPhone running VK Turn Proxy. Tapping
the link launches the app, shows a confirm alert with the deployment
fingerprint, and applies the settings on confirm. The same payload also
works pasted bare on the iPhone clipboard (Settings → Backup & Restore →
"Import from Connection Link").

Three ways to feed it:

    1. Edit the CONFIG dict below in-place with your deployment values
       and run with no args:

           python3 quick_link.py

    2. Pass a JSON file (same shape as CONFIG) as argv[1] — useful when
       managing multiple deployments via files in a private repo or
       password manager:

           python3 quick_link.py my-deployment.json

    3. Provision a NEW client: generate a fresh WireGuard keypair, override
       CONFIG["privateKey"] with it, and print BOTH the link (carrying the new
       private key) AND the matching server-side [Peer] block (new public key,
       AllowedIPs = <tunnelAddress IP>/32, + PresharedKey if set in CONFIG):

           python3 quick_link.py -gen-peer-key

       An optional second arg "ip/mask" overrides CONFIG["tunnelAddress"]
       (use a distinct tunnel IP per client):

           python3 quick_link.py -gen-peer-key 192.168.102.11/24

       peerPublicKey / vkLink / peerAddress still come from CONFIG — the server
       side is fixed; only the client keypair + tunnel IP vary per client.

Required fields (the link is rejected by the iOS parser if any are
missing or empty):

    privateKey       — WG client private key (base64)
    peerPublicKey    — WG server public key  (base64)
    tunnelAddress    — e.g. "192.168.102.3/24"
    vkLink           — https://vk.me/join/<token>
    peerAddress      — e.g. "1.2.3.4:51820" (the WG server, not the TURN)

allowedIPs is NOT emitted (removed 2026-06-11). The iOS app pins the
WireGuard peer allowed_ip to 0.0.0.0/0 — under includeAllNetworks=true that
is the only correct value (a narrower one blackholes traffic, never splits),
and the Settings field was removed in build 160. New links omit it and the
importer keeps the device default 0.0.0.0/0. OLD links that still carry
allowedIPs are still accepted + applied (ConnectionSettings.allowedIPs stays
Optional on the iOS side).

Optional fields (delete or comment out the CONFIG key to omit them from
the link — leaving an empty string still gets sent through and overwrites
the importer's current value with empty):

    presharedKey     — WG preshared key (base64). Made Optional in iOS build
                       134 — WireGuard PSK is itself optional in the protocol
                       (deployments without PSK use the all-zeros key). If
                       absent from the link, the importer keeps its current
                       PSK setting. If the receiving device has never had a
                       PSK and the deployment doesn't use one, omit this key
                       entirely. The script rejects literal "REPLACE_ME" so
                       you can't accidentally embed the placeholder.
    dnsServers       — e.g. "1.1.1.1"; if absent, importer keeps its current value
    numConnections   — int 1..50; if absent, importer keeps its current value
                       (default 30 in the iOS app)
    useDTLS          — bool. Made Optional in iOS build 129 (UI toggle had
                       been removed in build 127). Default true on the iOS
                       side — omit unless you specifically need to force
                       the no-DTLS direct-mode for debugging.
    useWrap          — bool. Made Optional in iOS build 129 (UI toggle had
                       been removed in build 115). WRAP is largely deprecated
                       since VK changed shape policy 2026-05-18; only set if
                       your peerAddress points at a -wrap-enabled server and
                       you have a matching wrapKeyHex below. Default false
                       on the iOS side.
    wrapKeyHex       — 64 hex chars matching server's -wrap-key. Only meaningful
                       when useWrap=true. Made Optional in iOS build 129.
    useSrtp          — bool, added 2026-05-20 (iOS build 115+). True means
                       client uses the DTLS+SRTP transport that bypasses VK's
                       per-allocation shape policy — server must run with the
                       -srtp flag (anton48/vk-turn-proxy add-server-srtp-layer
                       branch), typically on a separate port from the legacy
                       DTLS listener. If absent, importer keeps current value
                       (default false). Note: useSrtp=true overrides useDTLS
                       in the iOS dispatcher (SRTP path wins).
    useUDP           — bool, added 2026-05-22 (iOS build 128). False (default)
                       = TCP-control transport from client to TURN relay,
                       which bypasses VK's per-cred allocation-rate throttle
                       (introduced 2026-05-18). True = UDP-control, only useful
                       if your network blocks/throttles TCP to the relay and
                       you'd rather take VK's allocation-rate hit. If absent,
                       importer keeps current value (default false / TCP).
    useWrapA         — bool, added 2026-06-03 (iOS SRTP-WRAP-A mode). True =
                       connect to amurcanov's proxy-turn-vk-android server. The
                       server provisions WireGuard via GETCONF, so a WRAP-A
                       link carries NO WG keys — DELETE privateKey /
                       peerPublicKey / tunnelAddress / allowedIPs from CONFIG
                       (they're Optional on the iOS side as of this build).
                       Only vkLink, peerAddress (the amurcanov server host:port)
                       and wrapAPassword are required. If absent, importer keeps
                       its current value (default false).
    wrapAPassword    — string. The amurcanov shared secret (obfuscation key +
                       GETCONF auth). Required when useWrapA=True.
    turnServerOverride — optional "IP:port" (added 2026-06-08). Forces fresh
                       conns onto this TURN relay instead of VK's returned
                       address; disk-cached creds keep their stored address.
                       Omit / leave empty to use whatever VK returns.

Compat note: links generated against iOS build 128 or earlier MUST include
useDTLS, useWrap, and wrapKeyHex (iOS Codable rejects the link otherwise).
Build 129+ accepts their absence. Similarly, builds 133 or earlier require
presharedKey; build 134+ accepts its absence. quick_link.py keeps these
fields in CONFIG with safe defaults so links work with both eras — only
delete them from CONFIG if you know all importers are on the corresponding
build (129+ for useDTLS/useWrap/wrapKeyHex, 134+ for presharedKey).

What this DOES NOT include and never should:

    creds-pool.json    — TURN credentials are device-specific (PoW is keyed
                          to the WebView fingerprint at solve time). They
                          rebuild automatically on first connect.
    vk_profile.json    — captured browser fingerprint, also device-specific.

If you need to migrate a complete app state (settings + cached creds +
captured profile) between two of YOUR devices, use the Full Backup
Export/Import flow in the app instead.
