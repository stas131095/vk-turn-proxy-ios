	// UseWrap enables the WRAP obfuscation layer between DTLS and TURN

	// hiding the recognisable DTLS+WireGuard signature that VK's TURN
	// relays use to tag and throttle (peer_ip, peer_port) endpoints.

	// without that, the DTLS handshake fails because the server-side

	//
	// NOTE 2026-05-20: WRAP no longer escapes VK's content classifier
	// (see srtp_breakthrough_2026_05_19 memory file). The replacement
	// is UseSrtp below, which falls into VK's "recognised media" bucket

	// UseSrtp enables the DTLS+SRTP transport (see pkg/proxy/srtpwrap).

	//
	// Server side must run with the matching -srtp flag (anton48/
	// vk-turn-proxy add-server-srtp-layer branch, deployed on a
	// separate port from the legacy DTLS listener — typically :56004).
	// When UseSrtp is true the client MUST point at the SRTP-mode
	// server port; pointing at a non-SRTP server produces a clean
	// handshake failure.
	//
	// Empirical 2026-05-19/20: sustained 200+ KB/s per conn, 0 % loss,

// Field semantics:
//   - PhysFootprint: what iOS jetsam evaluates against the NE per-process
//     memory budget (~50 MB hard cap). The headline number — same as
//     the old `PhysFootprintFn` returned.
//   - Internal: private/anonymous resident pages — Go heap, Swift heap,
//     kernel mbufs attributed to the process. Growth here without a
//     corresponding Go `sys` rise points at non-Go allocation
//     (Swift host code, CFNetwork, NEPacketTunnelProvider framework,
//     mbuf clusters for in-flight TUN traffic).
//   - External: file-backed mappings — binary text, frameworks, dyld.
//     Should be roughly stable; sharp changes hint framework
//     load/unload (rare in a long-running NE).
//   - Reusable: pages marked MADV_FREE'd (kernel can reclaim them
//     without IO). Go's `heap-released` should be a subset
//     (Go releases idle heap this way). If Reusable >> heap-released,
//     something else is also freeing pages.
//   - Compressed: kernel-compressed (swapped) pages. Growth here means
//     system-wide pressure pushed our pages out of physical RAM into
//     compressed swap. Often a sign other apps are crowding us.
//
// Added 2026-05-26 (build 138) for finer-grained jetsam attribution
// after we observed phys_footprint silently growing ~28 MB in <50s
// during pure idleness (2026-05-26 16:26:45 kill) with no visible
// log activity — the standard memstats line couldn't tell us whether
// the growth was Go-side or non-Go.

//   - rss:            phys_footprint via Mach task_info — what iOS
//                     jetsam actually evaluates. The headline number;
//                     "n/a" if TaskVMInfoFn isn't wired up.
//   - vm-internal:    private/anonymous resident pages — Go heap +
//                     Swift heap + kernel mbufs + framework state.
//                     Growth here without Go `sys` rising points at
//                     non-Go allocation (CFNetwork, mbufs, Swift host).
//   - vm-external:    file-backed mappings — binary, frameworks, dyld.
//                     Should be roughly stable; sharp changes hint
//                     framework load/unload.
//   - vm-reusable:    pages MADV_FREE'd (kernel can reclaim). Go's
//                     heap-released is a subset. If vm-reusable >>
//                     heap-released, something non-Go is also freeing.
//   - vm-compressed:  kernel-compressed (swapped) pages. Growth = we
//                     got pushed into compressed swap due to system-
//                     wide pressure (often other apps crowding us).
//
// Go runtime (from runtime.MemStats, Go-only accounting):
//   - sys:            bytes Go mapped from the OS. On Darwin overstates
//                     resident by 10-20 MB because released pages stay
//                     in the address space until kernel reclaim.
//   - heap-alloc:     bytes of currently-live heap objects.
//   - heap-inuse:     in-use spans (>= heap-alloc; gap is fragmentation
//                     or retained-but-not-live within active spans).
//   - heap-idle:      bytes in idle (unused) spans, candidates for
//                     return-to-OS.
//   - heap-released:  bytes Go has explicitly released to the OS via
//                     madvise. heap-released growing alongside churn
//                     = scavenger working; stuck at zero while sys
//                     climbs = scavenger lazy.
//   - stack:          total stack memory (NumConns × per-conn goroutines
//                     × 8 KB initial). Not affected by GOMEMLIMIT.
//   - heap-objects:   count of live objects (rises with allocation
//                     leaks even when alloc bytes look stable).
//   - goroutines:     leak indicator; should stabilise at roughly
//                     NumConns × small-constant once startup settles.
//   - numGC:          GC cycle count; high deltas between ticks mean
//                     heavy alloc churn even if heap-alloc is steady.
//
// Correlation playbook for jetsam attribution:
//   - rss rising + sys rising together → Go-side allocation. Look at
//     heap-alloc, heap-objects, stack for the source.
//   - rss rising + sys flat → non-Go allocation. Check vm-internal
//     delta (probably the same magnitude as rss delta). If so, it's
//     Swift / framework / mbuf accumulation we can't see from Go.
//   - vm-compressed rising → system memory pressure, not our fault.
//     Check for unrelated jetsam events in sysdiagnose PowerLog.
//
// Final dump on shutdown captures the moment-of-death snapshot in
// the same place — useful when comparing pre-kill state across
// multiple jetsam incidents.

//                  Compare across ticks to spot rebinds that didn't

//                  allocation-time local IP matches os-default. In
//                  steady state this should be NumConns/NumConns once
//                  bootstrap finishes.
//   - stale:       any local IPs (and conn counts) that don't match
//                  os-default. Non-zero stale = some allocations are

// Conns whose connLocalIPs entry is empty (not currently allocated —

// Safe to call concurrently with logPathStatsLoop; both just emit

// maybeCountTransientError bumps the per-Proxy silent-degradation counter when

// indicates the VK TURN server is actively rejecting our requests. Both
// failure modes leave the allocation outwardly healthy (conns/lastRecvTime
// stay fresh) while throughput collapses, so the watchdog needs an explicit
// signal to detect the situation.
//
// Server-rejection errors from pion contain the substring "error response"
// because that's how the stun.MessageType for the error class stringifies
// (e.g. "CreatePermission error response (error 400: Bad Request)" or
// "unexpected response type ChannelBind error response"). Any other kind of
// failure is NOT a server rejection and must be excluded:
//
//   - "transaction closed" — pion cancelled in-flight transactions during
//     our own ForceReconnect (client.Close() path). No server rejection.
//   - "all retransmissions failed" — STUN transaction never got a reply,
//     network-layer drop (WiFi handoff, captive portal, iOS freezing the
//     UDP socket). Already covered by watchdog condition 1.
//   - "use of closed network connection" — pion tried to write to a UDP
//     socket we'd already closed during teardown.
//
// Rather than blacklisting each failure mode, we whitelist on the "error
// response" marker — if the server actually responded with an error, it's
// a real degradation signal; otherwise it's local-side noise we ignore.
// This is safe because "No transaction for Refresh error response" is
// logged by pion at Debugf level, not Warnf/Errorf, so it never reaches
// this function.
// maybeFlagAuthError surfaces a prominent log line whenever pion logs any
// auth-related error from VK (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden). Empirically
// over 2+ days of testing (April 2026) we have NEVER observed these — TURN
// allocations on a given cred work indefinitely as far as we can tell. The
// dedicated marker exists so that IF a cred actually does expire mid-session
// (most likely visible as "Fail to refresh permissions" with a 401 code from
// VK), we'll see it immediately and can react. Includes the scope (turnc /
// channelbind / etc.) and the original pion message.

	//     working but no NAT keepalive) consistently saw the extension

	//     of OUR traffic per cycle even when WG isn't actively sending
